As it is quite complex to start a new git project depending on a ton
of external libraries, here is a small how-to that describes how I
created this repository and configured my local machines.


1. Created repo nsgt-eval on github website.
2. Locally, git clone https://github.com/jganseman/nsgt-eval.git

3. git remote add ltfat git://git.code.sf.net/p/ltfat/code
4. git fetch ltfat
5. git merge -s ours --no-commit ltfat/master
	% add folder prefix to whatever thing is pulled from this repo:
6. git read-tree --prefix=ltfat/ -u ltfat/master
7. git commit -m "Imported ltfat as subtree"
	% pull the master branch of ltfat in subtree mode
8. git pull -s subtree ltfat master
