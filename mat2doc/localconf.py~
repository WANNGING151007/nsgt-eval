# ---- Project specific setups -----------------------------------------
#
# This file must define a structure for each project, with the
# following fields. Assume we consider the project 'myproject'
#
#   Source for the project. Must always be defined
#     myproject['dir'] = '/some/dir/myproject'
#   
#   For each target, you must define a field. This is where the output
#   is stored:
#
#     myproject['mat'] = '/some/dir/myprojectmat/'
#     myproject['php'] = '/some/dir/myprojectphp/'
#     myproject['pdf'] = '/some/dir/myprojectpdf/'
